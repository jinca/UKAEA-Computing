Definition of HPC
=================

"High Performance Computing most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power
in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer 
or workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business."

Brief HPC History
=================

| An illustration of the HPC timeline is available in the `Top 500 - The list <https://www.top500.org/timeline/>`_.
| According to `S Wright <https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/139909/1/foreword.pdf>`_, some HPC infrastructure ranked around the world:
